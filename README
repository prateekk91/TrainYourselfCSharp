Very often, you don't have a trainer to continuously watch you while doing exercises in gym, or at home. 
Result: You might end up doing exercises with incorrect postures and ending up with an injury.

Trainyourself is intended to provide you with live feedback on a Google Glass while you do your exercise.
The user's posture would be monitored by a Kinect placed in front of the user. The posture would be compared
against a set of ideal postures for the exercise, and if the user performs a pose incorrectly, our application
will not allow him/her to proceed with the next step in the exercise.

We used google glass to provide feedback because its not possible for the user to be continuously looking at a screen
placed in front of him. Very often you perform exercises where its not physically possible to look forward (at the screen)
without disforming your posture during exercising. A google glass would be in front of the user's eyes no matter where
the user is looking.

This is the Kinect part of the application, developed in C#. The C# code is communicating with the Google Glass using web sockets.
